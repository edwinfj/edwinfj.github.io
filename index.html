		<p>A Quora post about how to become a good software engineer. The author is a googler. Thereefore we can trust him to some extent for professional advice. The post contains the author's perspecitve of what is a good software engineer, and recommendations of resource for academic and non-academic learning. Most of the resource can be found online. One note: part of the post is transformed from Google's "Technical Development Guide".</p>

		<p>Nowadays almost every renowned university has its own open courseware. Some special of MIT's is that you don't have to spend a penny to get access his course content. I personally love his "find course by topic" feature. You see what courses to take once you decide which topic to dive into. Yet another outstanding part of this courseware is that the sequence and prerequisit of a course are displayed together with the course. Therefore you know whether you can take this course. If not, you know what courses to take before this one. Upon finish, you know what course to follow next if you are really interested in this topic.</p>
