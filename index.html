<!-- online courses that have helped me -->
<section id="olcourse">
	<h1 title="They helped me a lot. Hope they can help you as well :)">Online Courses that I've taken</h1>
	<div class="olcourseintro"> 
		<p>Initially, I took online courses just for fun. With more and more courses that I took, I realized that software &amp; algorithm is truely what I'm good at and passionate about. I have been a programming enthusiast and coding now and then since undergraduate. Maybe it's time for me to consider it seriously.</p>
		<p>I'm really grateful for all the MOOC platforms, and I can never appreciate more the spirit of knowledge sharing. I'm certainly a beneficiary of this spirit, and hope to convey it to others. Therefore, I listed below all the online courses I took in reverse chronological order, as for your reference. Besides, I also found this Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html">"Technical Development Guide"</a> quite useful. Hope my share of experience can help a little to those who want to transit to SW/algo during their early career.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition | Stanford</a></h2>
			<div class="difficulty">intermediate</div>
			<div class="recommend">5</div>
		</div>
		<p class="olcoursedescription">Application of neural network on computer vision. This course provides in depth discussion of convolutional neural net and recurrent neural net. Even though no videos are provided, you can follow the detailed course notes to learn the topics taught in class. Coding is a heavy part of the course, which is a big plus.</p>

			<div class="difficulty">advanced</div>
			<div class="recommend">4</div>
		</div>
		<p class="olcoursedescription">A further exploration of neural network. The content of the course is not self-contained. You probably have to spend time reading extra materials to understand the topics discussed in the course. Nevertheless, the structure of this course is well designed and the instructor is one of the best in this area, it's worth your time to digest those topics.</p>

		</div>
		<p class="olcoursedescription">A Machine learning introductory for everyone. Having basic knowledge of linear algebra is enough to follow the course. There is a very good online community to support this course. This course is the simplified and trimmed version of <a href="https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229">Stanford CS229</a>.</p>

			<div class="difficulty">intermediate</div>
			<div class="recommend">3</div>
		</div>
		<p class="olcoursedescription">This course discusses system design topics such as modularity, atomicity, reliability, security, etc. Examples are introduced with each topic. You can find most of the course videos. Course materials are a little out of date. Since the course is not designed for online learning, the learning procedure is quite dry and the learnings you can get is limited.</p>

		<p class="olcoursedescription">If you ever wonder "how computer works" or "why computer can solve so many real life problems" or "how OS works" or "what benefits we can get from multi-core", this course is the answer for you. Lead by the instructor, you will witness the formation of a computer, from CMOS gate to chips, from hardware components to full computer architecture, from instructions to operating systems. You will get the chance to build a computer yourself and write a simple OS. It's the online version of MIT 6.004. I personally think this is a must take for non-CS background pals.</p>

		<p class="olcoursedescription">"This is CS50". If you are a CS MOOCer you must be familiar with this slogan. If you've already taken a CS intro course back at school, you can skip the lecture videos. However, the programming assignments can be very interesting, if you try to understand every line of code.</p>
