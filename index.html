		<h2>Biography | Vision</h2>
			<p>I'm educated on applied physics, and employed in semiconductor industry as an application engineer.<br>
			However, my enthusiasm towards computer science has never faded. On the contrast, it grows stronger as I'm departing furhter away from it.<br>
			Therefore, I'm spending my spare time trying to live it out loud. All the endeavors, reading, programming, and debugging alone in the dark nights.<br>
			Hope some day, I can do the things I love and live on it. And maybe inspire someone as well.<br>
			If I can do it, you can do it.</p>
