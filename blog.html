		<b><i>
		Question: "use 9 points to draw 10 lines, each line has at least 3 points".</i></b></blockquote>
		I saw this question in a manga column whose topic is programmers (I love this column). I am naturally sensitive to space and structures, so I couldn't help thinking about the solution. I didn't have paper by my side at that moment, so I pictured the answers in my mind. I often do this.<br />
		<br />
		The first solution that came up to me quickly is img.1. Apparently only 8 lines exist. Then after some brainstorm, I came up a second solution as in img.2. Seems good, but there are 4 intersections in the structure that are not regarded as points as shown in img.3.<br />
		<div class="imgcentered">
		<img class="imgframed" border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gSVfJz5wJg8/V5g92RAacAI/AAAAAAAALMc/dNmj3kB0pio8vIoNNW7jQu296CI1DPETQCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-27%2Bat%2B12.49.01%2BPM.png" /></div>
		Then I realized, the question itself is ambiguous. <b>It does not clearly define what is a point</b>. If we define a point as "intersections of two lines", then my solution is not valid any more.<br />
		<br />
		So, to get the right answer, either I prove "intersections of two lines are points" cannot stand, or I come up another solution.<br />
		<br />
		To prove "intersections of two lines are points" does not stand, I tried below model.<br />
		<ul>
			<li>first, there are 9 points, and 10 lines. Label 10 lines as 0 to 9. The order does not matter since all lines are the same.</li>
			<li>second, each point has at least 2 lines</li>
			<li>third, each line appears on at least 3 points</li>
			<li>fourth, any line combination in a point cannot appear on another point</li>
		</ul>
		All four conditions have to be met to build the solution.<br />
		<br />
		To translate img.2 to the model, I got img.4.<br />
		<div class="imgcentered">
		<img class="imgframed" border="0" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SlTrA565Y5s/V5hDCwAl3UI/AAAAAAAALMs/xOe4nAvxZ-Y3qse-EzH8a_IrJGP9C8SCwCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-27%2Bat%2B1.11.22%2BPM.png" width="640" /></a></div>
		Apparently, if we put one line on more points, the fewer points other lines can appear. Therefore, a rule of thumb is: <b>the</b>&nbsp;<b>fewer points one line appears on, the better</b>.<br />
		Another observation is, since there are so many intersections between the lines, it seems they are more likely to be in the same plane. I don't know how to prove it yet, so just limit the question to 2D. 3D condition can be discussed later.<br />
		The 2D assumption brings another derivative. <b>If line a crosses line b and line c in a point, and crosses line d in another point, d must crosses either b or c or both on points other than the two mentioned before</b>. This derivative can predict those implicit intersections that shown in img.3.<br />
		<br />
		Now combine the rule of thumb and the derivative, here we go.<br />
		Among the 9 points, 6 of them have 3 lines each, and 3 of them have 4 lines each. The latter 3 points have 12 lines in total, so either 1 line appears 3 time or 2 lines appear twice each. Consider "2 lines appear twice each" condition, name one of the two lines as A. A appear on two points that have 4 lines, and on 1 point that have 3 lines, as shown below.<br />
		<div class="imgcentered">
		<img class="imgframed" border="0" height="164" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2jyOg637Z7M/V5hRDFbZbEI/AAAAAAAALNM/KzCneR-NGrw-un-ov4CSjtMcq3pi6TKkQCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-07-27%2Bat%2B2.12.44%2BPM.png" width="320" /></a></div>
		Consider the left point and the right point. There are 3 more lines in the left point. <b>Each of them must have at least 2 intersections with the lines in the right point. All these intersections must be different otherwise different lines will collapse into the same line.</b> Therefore, except the 3 points here, there must be at least 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 extra points, total 9 standalone points now. The "2&nbsp;+ 2&nbsp;+ 2" stands only if each of the 3 lines in the left point has corresponding parallel line respectively in the right point. Even if the "parallel" condition met, the 2 lines in the middle point is impossible not to create more intersections (1 line is possible though). Therefore, the "9 points" requirement in the question is violated.<br />
		The "1 line appears 3 times" condition can apply the same analysis and get the same conclusion.<br />
		<br />
		Therefore, <b>in the 2D world, this question does not hold!</b><br />
		<br />
		Now what's left is to find a solution in 3D world, or prove the 9 points must appear in one plane.

		<h1 class="artiletitle centertxt">My interpretation of Monty Hall Problem</h1>

			<div>
			Note: While composing this post, I haven't checked any explanation of Monty Hall Problem. I only know the question itself and the correct answer.<div/>
			<div>
			I saw this problem yesterday evening. I have a horrible neighbor, watching TV after midnight. I was waken up by her TV noise this early morning again. I could not fall asleep. Then suddenly I began to think about the problem, and figured out the right solution.<div/>
			<br>
			<h2>The Question:</h2>
			<div>
			There are three doors. Behind one door there is a goat. Behind the other two it's empty. Your goal is to choose the door that has a goat behind. Here we go.</div>
			<div>
			First, you choose a door.</div>
			<div>
			Then second, among the other two doors, one of them that is empty will open for you. Now only two doors left, one you have chosen, one you did not choose. Now the question: should you change your choice to the other closed door?</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<h2>
			The logic pitfall:</h2>
			<div>
			Most people think "no need to change the door. since there are only two doors left, one with goat behind, one empty. each one has 1/2 chance to have the goat". I did the same mistake.<br />
			<br />
			The pitfall is, if we think that way, we <b>implicitly assume the second step is a independent case</b> (which is not). We are re-telling the story like: now only two doors left, one has a goat behind, what's the probability of each door that has a goat behind respectively?<br />
			Apparently, we are telling the story in the wrong way.<br />
			<br />
			It reminds me of the middle school question: a lucky draw, we need to select 10 winners from 50 candidates. Two ways. One is randomly pick 10 winners at once. The other is randomly pick 1 winner at once, and repeat it 10 times.<br />
			Question: is the probability of one person to be picked the same in way 1 and way 2?<br />
			The pitfall is someone may think: in way 2, we pick 1 winner, now only 49 left, then each person has 1/49 chance to be picked next time, higher than 1/50 at the beginning.<br />
			This is the same pitfall as the one in Monty Hall Problem: they all forget the first step influences the probability in the second step, and we are talking about the probability of the whole story.<br />
			<br />
			<h2>
			Solution 1:</h2>
			In the second step, one empty door is open for you. Even though it's opened, if we look at the question from the most beginning, the open door is still one of the three doors. Now if you choose the other closed door, <b>the opened door is part of your choice as well</b>. It's like, in the first step, you choose one door or choose two doors. If you change to the other closed door in the second step, it equals to you choose two doors in the first step.<br />
			Now in the second step, when one empty door is open, it actually help you eliminate an empty door among the two doors for you. Now you have one door left. The only chance you <b>miss</b> is the goat is behind the "one door in the first step", which is 1/3. Therefore you have 2/3 chance to win if you "change to the other closed door in the second step".<br />
			<br />
			<h2>
			Solution 2:</h2>
			A more academic approach.<br />
			If we don't change, the probability of us winning: we chose the right door in step 1, which is 1/3.<br />
			If we change, the probability of us winning: the other two doors other than the one we choose in step 1 are one empty&nbsp;+ one with a goat. The probability is 1/3*2 = 2/3.</div>
