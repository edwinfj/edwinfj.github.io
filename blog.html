			Note: While composing this post, I haven't checked any explanation of Monty Hall Problem. I only know the question itself and the correct answer.<div/>
			<div>
			I saw this problem yesterday evening. I have a horrible neighbor, watching TV after midnight. I was waken up by her TV noise this early morning again. I could not fall asleep. Then suddenly I began to think about the problem, and figured out the right solution.<div/>
			<br>
			<h2>The Question:</h2>
			<div>
			There are three doors. Behind one door there is a goat. Behind the other two it's empty. Your goal is to choose the door that has a goat behind. Here we go.</div>
			<div>
			First, you choose a door.</div>
			<div>
			Then second, among the other two doors, one of them that is empty will open for you. Now only two doors left, one you have chosen, one you did not choose. Now the question: should you change your choice to the other closed door?</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<h2>
			The logic pitfall:</h2>
			<div>
			Most people think "no need to change the door. since there are only two doors left, one with goat behind, one empty. each one has 1/2 chance to have the goat". I did the same mistake.<br />
			<br />
			The pitfall is, if we think that way, we <b>implicitly assume the second step is a independent case</b> (which is not). We are re-telling the story like: now only two doors left, one has a goat behind, what's the probability of each door that has a goat behind respectively?<br />
			Apparently, we are telling the story in the wrong way.<br />
			<br />
			It reminds me of the middle school question: a lucky draw, we need to select 10 winners from 50 candidates. Two ways. One is randomly pick 10 winners at once. The other is randomly pick 1 winner at once, and repeat it 10 times.<br />
			Question: is the probability of one person to be picked the same in way 1 and way 2?<br />
			The pitfall is someone may think: in way 2, we pick 1 winner, now only 49 left, then each person has 1/49 chance to be picked next time, higher than 1/50 at the beginning.<br />
			This is the same pitfall as the one in Monty Hall Problem: they all forget the first step influences the probability in the second step, and we are talking about the probability of the whole story.<br />
			<br />
			<h2>
			Solution 1:</h2>
			In the second step, one empty door is open for you. Even though it's opened, if we look at the question from the most beginning, the open door is still one of the three doors. Now if you choose the other closed door, <b>the opened door is part of your choice as well</b>. It's like, in the first step, you choose one door or choose two doors. If you change to the other closed door in the second step, it equals to you choose two doors in the first step.<br />
			Now in the second step, when one empty door is open, it actually help you eliminate an empty door among the two doors for you. Now you have one door left. The only chance you <b>miss</b> is the goat is behind the "one door in the first step", which is 1/3. Therefore you have 2/3 chance to win if you "change to the other closed door in the second step".<br />
			<br />
			<h2>
			Solution 2:</h2>
			A more academic approach.<br />
			If we don't change, the probability of us winning: we chose the right door in step 1, which is 1/3.<br />
			If we change, the probability of us winning: the other two doors other than the one we choose in step 1 are one empty&nbsp;+ one with a goat. The probability is 1/3*2 = 2/3.</div>
